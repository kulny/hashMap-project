extend CLI with multiple commands from a single input e.g. nn or n/n etc to double negative and immediately exit the program, or y3 to jump from creating
or reading directly into writing.

reader/search function someday

EXTEND INPUT FEATURES  how?????

someday extend to phone and allow remote notes that automatically sync with files on computer

add commands to write() such that /n or /y or etc can jump to future commands or you can simply continue to write with a new line
