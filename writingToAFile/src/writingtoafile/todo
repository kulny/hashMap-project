extend CLI with multiple commands from a single input e.g. nn or n/n etc to double negative and immediately exit the program, or y3 to jump from creating
or reading directly into writing.

reader/search function someday

jump from creating a file directly to writing to it "Would you like to write to this new file?" etc


EXTEND INPUT FEATURES  how?????

someday extend to phone and allow remote notes that automatically sync with files on computer

add commands to write() such that /n or /y or etc can jump to future commands or you can simply continue to write with a new line
