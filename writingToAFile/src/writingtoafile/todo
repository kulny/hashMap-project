extend CLI with multiple commands from a single input e.g. nn or n/n etc to double negative and immediately exit the program, or y3 to jump from creating
or reading directly into writing.

reader/search function someday

EXTEND INPUT FEATURES  how?????

someday extend to phone and allow remote notes that automatically sync with files on computer

add commands to write() such that /n or /y or etc can jump to future commands or you can simply continue to write with a new line


figure out persistent variables such as directory for deployment of app 
namely, so it can have a default save space that doesn't have to be set from
the source code

^ .ini file? etc

begin to implement this as part of a larger project namely the --
---
conWorld Builder
--- or
Notes taker
--- or
p saver

create gui interface to change the directory in some ini file or something

add way to see what files are in the selected directory

solve issues with readProperties.getProperties("usrSetDir") returning null and creating a nullpointerexception
try to find a way to initialize the intendedDir string from the properties file at the calling of the CLI method?
